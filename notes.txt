Problem:

Stretch:
renaming a character should update references everywhere in the summaries?

Prompt:
I'm working on an app that let's you create an outline of a book and then convert the outline into prompts that can be fed into an AI to get back prose. I call it novel prompter. It is an electron app. I've attached all the code files. Read all the files and prepare for further instructions

Tips:
use full names in character descriptions to show relations. Dont use pronouns as it can confuse the AI
