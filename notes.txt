Tasks:
when add entry open create entry dialog first instead of just creating new entry.
Keep type empty instead of prepopulating it
Description should have placeholder text instead of prefilling it with description

Nice to have:
collapsible left sidebar

Problem:
renaming a character should update references everywhere in the summaries?

Stretch:
generate idea button
the summary and text barrier must be adjustable

Prompt:
I'm working on an app that let's you create an outline of a book and then convert the outline into prompts that can be fed into an AI to get back prose. I call it novel prompter. It is an electron app. I've attached all the code files. Read all the files and prepare for further instructions

Tips:
use full names in character descriptions to show relations. Dont use pronouns as it can confuse the AI
